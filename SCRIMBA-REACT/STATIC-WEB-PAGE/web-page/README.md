### Challenge 1: 

- Starting from scratch, build and render the 
HTML for our section project. Check the Google slide for 
what you're trying to build.

- We'll be adding styling to it later.

Hints:
* The React logo is a file in the project tree, so you can
  access it by using `src="./react-logo.png" in your image
  element
* You can also set the `width` attribute of the image element
  just like in HTML. In the slide, I have it set to 40px
 */


### Challenge 2: 

- Add a `header` element with a nested `nav` element. Inside the `nav`,
  include a `img` element with the image of the React logo inside
  (src="./react-logo.png") and make sure to set the width to something
  more manageable so it doesn't take up the whole screen
- Add an `h1` with some text describing the page. (E.g. "Reasons
  I'm excited to learn React"). Place it above the ordered list.
- Add a `footer` after the list that says: 
    "Â© 20xx <last name here> development. All rights reserved."


### Challenge 3: 

- Add an `ul` inside the Header's `nav` and create
  the following `li`s: "Pricing", "About", & "Contact"
- Using flexbox, line up the nav items horizontally, and
  put them inline with the React logo.


### Challenge 4: Project setup

- Create a `components` folder
- Create the following components in separate files inside
  the components folder.  In each one, just render an `h1` 
  with the name of the component e.g. return <h1>Navbar goes here</h1>
    - Navbar
    - Main
- Create an App component outside the components folder (sibling to
  the index.js file)
    - Have App render the Navbar and Main components
- Import and render the App component inside of index.js using ReactDOM
    - At this point you should have your "Navbar goes here" etc. showing up
      in the mini-browser.
- Go to Google fonts and get the "Inter" font with weights 400, 600, and 700.
  Put the links to those fonts ABOVE the style.css link in index.html (Use
  the `<link/>` elements instead of the @import or npm options for getting
  the fonts. You may need to do some extra research to figure out how this 
  works if you haven't done it before)


### Challenge 5: Build the main section!

Skip 2 aspects of the design for now:
1. The colored bullets in the list
2. The larger React logo on the side

Those will be separate challenges coming up.


 
### Challenge 6: Place the gray react logo in the background

- Don't use an `img` element, but rather set it as the
`background-image` of the `main` element.

Hint: you'll need to use the following properties:
- background-image
- background-repeat
- background-position

(Or the shorthand `background` property with values for all
those other properties)
